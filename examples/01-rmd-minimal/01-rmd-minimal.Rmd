title: "Getting Started with Rmd Files"

This a simple document that illustrates the use of Rmd files.

Here's a first __code chunk__ using the data set `cars` that comes in R

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Here's another chunk:

```{r}
# matrix of correlation
cor(cars)
```


### Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Inline code

You can also include __inline code__. For example, `cars` has `r nrow(cars)`
rows. The average speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.


### Some Equations

Likewise, it is possible to include equations like the following one:
$$
dist = f(speed)
$$
