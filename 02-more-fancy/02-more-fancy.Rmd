```

This a simple document that illustrates how to use Rmd files with R.

Here's a first __code chunk__ using the data set `cars` that comes in R

```{r, comment=''}
summary(cars)
```



Here's another chunk:

```{r, comment=''}
# matrix of correlation
cor(cars)
```


### Plots

Here's an interactive plot produced by combining packages `"ggplot2"` and `"plotly"`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(col = '#FF7722')

plot_ly(p)
```

You can hover any of the points to see the actual coordiantes.


### Inline code

You can also include __inline code__. For example, `cars` has `r nrow(cars)`
rows. The average speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.


### Some Equations

Likewise, it is possible to include equations. We can write a model like this:
$$
dist = f(speed)
$$

```{r}
# regression model
reg <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)

summary(reg)
```

The regression equation is:

`r sprintf('dist = %0.2f + %0.2f speed', reg$coefficients[1], reg$coefficients[2])`

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=8}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(reg, which = 1:4)
par(op)
```
