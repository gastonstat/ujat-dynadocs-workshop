## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by 
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) and Aaron Swartz allowing people 
"to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert 
it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".

### Markdown Tutorial

Work on this [Interactive online markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)


### More practice

If you are new to Markdown, you can try using one of the several 
online Markdown editors and parsers such as:

- [markdown live preview](http://markdownlivepreview.com/)
- [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor)
- [dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)

These are nice tools that will allow you to practice the syntax, while 
getting an idea of how the output may look like. 
There are also markdown editors that you can download:
