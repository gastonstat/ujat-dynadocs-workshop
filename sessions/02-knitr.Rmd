## What is `"knitr"`?

`"knitr"` is an R package that "Provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic 
report generation in R using Literate Programming techniques."

More technical details available at [yihui.name/knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) 


## About Literate Programming

Donald Knuth coined the term __"Literate Programming"__ 

> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of 
> programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be 
> works of literature. Hence, my title: "Literate Programming."
> 
> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
> let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a 
> computer to do.

(1984) Literate Programming. CSLI, 1992, pg. 99.
