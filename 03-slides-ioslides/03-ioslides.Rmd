## Code chunks

Here's a first __code chunk__ using the data set `cars` that comes in R

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## More chunks

Here's another chunk:

```{r}
# matrix of correlation
cor(cars)
```


# Plots

## Basic Plot

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

## Fancy Plot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(col = '#FF7722')

plot_ly(p)
```


## Inline code

You can also include __inline code__. For example, `cars` has `r nrow(cars)`
rows. The average speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.


## Some Equations

Likewise, it is possible to include equations. We can write a model like this:
$$
dist = f(speed)
$$
